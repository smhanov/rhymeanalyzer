My gun go click and spark Don't leave
witnesses to point me out on one o six and park
Son those slick remarks Gon' get you

Ya walk through my peas and carrots Wind up hooked
on machines, livin' like peas and carrots
Ya team wanna beef Thats when i screw
the muzzle on the tip and strap the beam underneath
When i ride through, ya dont see no lid
I put snipers on the roof like nino did
All it takes is some see no slid And have you
on the news askin anyone, if they seen yo kid
I dont scream it in a rough tone But i got spots
in the whip to stuff crome, that would of puff combs
Every hustler on this planet had
Givin' away twenties so big, they in sandwhich bags, nigga

These niggaz gots to be punched Act stupid
get shells in ya stomache, like you ate pasta for lunch
If i let this diablo door raid
I'ma have the front of ya crib lookin like diallos doorway
See i know all yay, we buy ours pure-yay
We waitin on boats, these guys know broadway
Ya gon make me tie a bomb under ya benz
See how much you talk wit firearms under ya chin
No you cant take the coupe wit ditches Cause when i hit
the highway, it always makes the croup suspicous
Please, i get my dollar from the hersey
I'm on that fly gangsta shit, i pop the collar on my jersey
You know i got the heat the way the vanson is bendin
Same laid back flow, no dancin' or grinnin'
Who else can it be spellin it at them You have them
tappin they friend like 'i'm tellin you thats him', stupid

Fab's livin the vida loca Only nigga
in the hood you can come see for either weed or coca
Nark's wanna see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
D.e.a been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When i came through in the benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck wanna beef My fendi knits be
3x so you can't see whats tucked underneath
And i might not even drop Just take
my advance and make a small town in cleveland pop
"vivrant thing" on my hip, that will make you "breathe and stop"
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, your roll with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at I leave niggas
m.i.a. and i ain't talkin where the heat play at

Niggas don't think i'm still shavin crack Cause i pull up in a truck
with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and beard covered And i keep
a leathal weapon like mel gidson and dan glover
Now i lose v money and c lo And the cops
think me and muggs is g money and nino
I don't hit these honey's with c-notes Rather put them
on greyhound, strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants I get nike's
from aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something bout the beamer x5 When i come through
it be increaseing a skeo's sex drive
Half the click look like they struck genisis up
The other half is tryin to wrap they sentences up
T'n never gone hate, half these artists never slum weight
When they call n.y., its the only time they touch the 7-1-8

I lay low on the other side of the globe Carat's hangin out
the side of my lobe Pull in ya drivers side and unload
They find ya when its time for your ride to be towed On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya rove
Ya'll niggas ain't ain't gangstas til y'all ridin And fed's tell ya
hit a chick once and she runnin back like fred taylor
I'm snatchin everything in the pj's now
Thats why most these niggas in workin with the d.a.'s now

Rollin, gold two seater 
Stash in the dash Hold two heaters
Blockah put holes through beaters
Ghetto fab stroll through cheetahs
Ballin, brooklyn dawn
Addicted to cris hooked on don
15 g's hookers on
Ma, i wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin, guys that send po's
Cause i chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me, I tried the hen hold
Look at the hurt your eyes will squit close
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Listen to the two way alert
It goes
Lets go vip boo raise your skirt

I'm gangsta Ya'll just wannabe's
Federal agents on their p's
30 grand 28 on the keys
Gotta good lawyer i'm gonna squeeze
Thuggin' jeans and tim's
Fitted to the front lean the brim
Ride but never on teenage rims
And i keep a chick's face between my limbs
Stylin ya'll heard about my kick game
I'm on the parkway see me at the knick game
Probably seen this tatted on your chick frame
F-a-b-o-l-o-u-s
Ridin ya'll know as well i do
That's the way you can tell i flew
So i got a deal i sell pot too
Cause before i hit the pens i'm gettin bailed by clue

Cruisin top on the 'cedes low
Turn us up when you hear this on the radio
Blastin with the nineteen eighty flow
Make the necks on the ladies go
Holla that's what a pretty thug will do
Hit branson get a fifty jug or two
Ya'll throwin on them gritty mugs for who
Like ya'll don't know what fifty slugs will do
Hatin i just bought the bulls
I put ya'll in the front page articles
I got em lookin at the billboard charts confused
And i still freestyle to start the clue's
Reppin i'm that kid about the doe
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Shit platinum out the door
Now i drop the top down just to shout to hoes

Yo, yall gon' hear this in the nightclubs for a year
When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares
It's like bugs up in here Like thugs up in here
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Haters - might have a slight grudge when i'm there
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear
Ladies pass through, i might rub on her rear
Pop cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear the way i like strut up in here
Don't get the nike's smudged that i wear
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin The way the pinky-ringin
link be blingin, you think we slingin?
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin behind ya
18 inches and up, no sittin on minors
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin the lines
And end up in a hotel, gettin vagina

Ladies- rub ya tits if ya gettin right
Niggas- grab ya dicks if ya gettin right
Don't be thinkin bout that nigga that you wit tonite
Don't be thinkin bout that chick that you wit tonite

Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it You like the way
the drop i got is kitted Cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits Must be
how i hop on yachts and visit, tropic spots i did it
The top the watch is glitted Make niggas wanna
bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like i won't pop a shot in fitteds I got the type
of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin shoppin spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Neva get checked, me and my glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lis You aint
got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?

Yall hardly see i be 'round
But when i do, i be, i be down in a vip lounge
I get in the club, i dont need i.d. now
Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound
Yall know how that kid from b-stuy be down
Yall see my c-pound, yall see yall be drowned
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down
which sheet i meet down I know she gettin right- hey
Ladies tug me when i strut
So this thug be in the cut, takin bubbly to the gut
Rays beamin, yall think i be day-dreamin
But i stay schemin like, "shortie could get it"
They screamin, they see all this ice and grey gleamin
They like "damn, shortie could get it"
And i may be crazy But i see some ladies
tonite that should be drinkin my baby's baby

Load the 4-4 up Im the reason the price of raw go up
Jump outta of the lambo, and the doors go up
Hit you and your ho up From the torso up
Leave ya'll there til the coroner or the law show up
Im that nigga they say performing so the whores show up
Why cop?, i rob you, ice your roll up
I pop bottles, ain't no need for no cup
Roll the pure dro up, stroll the floor tore up
The difference between fab and ya'll, after i pick an auto up
Every month i ain't gotta give more doe up
Fuckin' with this you'll buy a washer when the shore slow up
I have it when ya kids see-saw go up I see four blow up
Check these diamonds, no flaws show up
My niggas clap up parties, shoot tour shows up
What ya'll know bout head til a chicks jaw swoll up
Goin' gold minutes after the gates on stores go up
You know who done it now, few hundred miles
And with shoes on it now It's like a few hundred thou
When we run up this guns 2 stomach style
Got to flaunt it now Nigga who want it blawgh

Yo, you must wanna die From the nigga you testify against
Fabolous make bail before they identify the prints
Swing by a vince, in a buggy eye with tents
Sittin on nineteen's, gun stash by the vents
Niggas is lookin at the chain cause they eyes'll squint
I pull up, pull out, pull back Them guys will sprint
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since
Got a deal, no sellin', been supplyin since
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints
We done make ya eyes look bent, just by the sense
These niggas dont believe, then they gone die convinced
Once i present the four fifth why comment
Im the type you tell ya dame bout Push a fellow brain out
Leave'em in front of the spot that they sell cocaine out
One single, had to tint the yellow range out
Everybody runnin' up tryin' to spell the name out

It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lo mein
Breaking day on the grind, i used to be so drained
But ain't a saturday i wasn't up to see soul train
Sometimes i ain't see no gain Cause i was
runnin to ralphies everytime my trees showed stains
I was lucky i ain't see four main
Get shot or stuck up standin at them c-lo games
But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain Be saying
"that's nasty", wouldn't give me no brain
Ya'll surprised f-a-b-o's sane In my rolla life
i done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes

I just want some peace of mind Nigga's will risk
havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine
Know that i'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a caprice confined
But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'rican and guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine She get
every doll for christmas, new jordans at easter-time
Some be like "at least you signed"
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And i be gettin nikes before they even get released sometime
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine And if
you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

go way back when I could walk thru
and ain't nobody know jay jackson
Everything was ok back then Now everybody
playin a cool role and i know they actin
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with o shea jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they mack 10s
And i'm the one the po's stay trackin
Plus i got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins But i swear to god
i won't never take o.j's actions
If i would've let this flow stay packed in I'd probably be
with nick and 'rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now i just roll on those eight jacksons
till clue and duro brings those Gray plaques in

You're the one baby girl, i've never been so sure
Your skin's so pure, the type men go for
The type i drive the benz slow for
The type i be beepin the horn, rollin down the windows for
Never been no whore So to get you in closed doors
i buy you everything in those stores
This, that, and those yours
As long as fabolous the only one you let that grin show for
You ain't gotta spend no more, i'm a put a rock on your hand
You ain't gotta say "we just friends" no more
I shine, you shine, it never been no flaws
I ain't like most who just wanna get in those drawers
'cause every king need a queen And with me
and you girl i ain't tryna let a thing in between
It ain't a thing, nahmean chicks hate, show 'em the ring
and the green And let your middle finger be seen

you know the way i ball's to pick and roll
Like stockton and malone when we play the mall
I be goin out my way to call 'cause i love the way
your hips make your jeans seem like they too small
Them see-through tops with your titties exposed When you kick off
them shoes there ain't bitty whose toes as pretty as those
That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids
And i ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight Got a thick set
of thighs and struts like
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack But i think
i slipped when i saw them full lips covered with mac
You got everything that others would lack
Along with the f-a, b-o, l-o, u-s
Your patience i personally admire
'cause i started out a player now i'm 'bout to have my jersey retired

There ain't no "mights" or "maybe" I done did wrong
so i'm a make sure it's right for my baby
You know how tight that my day be
And how long and stressin them flights to l.a. be
Ain't no rumor gon' get back to your friends
Before i let a nigga disrespect you i be back in the pen
Front to back you a ten You got me thinkin
'bout puttin a car seat in back of the benz, uh

Yeah, the kid been makin these mami's, yall "papacita"
Since kangols and shell-top adidas
Love when te-ta's look like they pop through beaters
And the hips won't fit in the l-drop two-seater
But ma' i ain't the type to love ya
I'm a triflin, good for nothin, type a brother
This cute face'll make your wife smile And i check in
two bags and one's just a suitcase full of liftstyles
And we both rent out playa Difference is
you a sweet subsitute, i'm a penthouse playa
Y'all seen my rings borders It's full of
queen and king's daughters, as clean as spring water
'f's for the freakin, 'a's alright
'b's for bottles that pop all night
'o's for the ounces that i got
That we blow everyday, know why, why not?

It's the hoodrat hugh hefner, that bend dimes, too
The five plus one, sittin on ten times two
Shorty when i'm through..... I'm a know
if you nice on the mic and if your friend rhyme, too
It's so funny how i suit the women
They know i'm still spendin show money from "superwoman"
They like "where'd he get those twenties?" And " i ain't know
that's a color that a coupe could come in, dammit man"
All i say to the heffers is "jesus"
Keep swallowin my kids, might as well have no nephews and nieces
I know you wanna slip proof And try an make me
crack a smile, just so you can see my chipped tooth
I'm tryna' get you, in and out of my room
Just to get, in and out of your womb
And rocks in mine glare, somethin, like times square
Excuse me miss, you want me to sign where?

Fab's hard to be found But most likely
i'm with a foreign damn who name's hard to pronouce
I started out, gettin hard by the ounce
No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts
The way i make 'em nod to the bounce Somebody call
silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme My closest
look like i keep gettin traded from team to team
Looks sleezy, it's difficult
but me and tim the only ones that make pimpin 
Look easy Tell me how i'm gonna make my album cleaner
Even bitches suckin me like vacuum cleaners
Even chickens wanna cluck outside
(yo' fab, it must be the truck outside)
And mami can't stop eyein And when i said
my rims was only nineteens, she said "stop lyin!"

You gotta love the way this playa be minglin
If you don't tell yo man mama, i ain't sayin a thing and
That nigga got you used to the h.n.o. kingston
I'm fuckin limbos, lay on the wingfin
By the way i be blingin, the pay that i bring in
Mind spendin a day with the kingpin?
Answer yo cell, all day it been ringin
Tell that nigga, we on our way out to england
Them hips and tips, the way they be swingin
The way the be jinglin, letz stay til the spring and
Know i thugged you out, the way that you drinkin
And don't be scared cabby, the yay i be slingin
Ma, i'm where you wanna be, if not
We can hop in a lid and fly where you wanna be
Yea, you a g, the type that ryde with them
cameraz Instead of the rearviews on the v, i know

You just gotta stay patient boo I'ma make sho to take you
where eva you dream a vacation to
You can push the grey station thru
I'ma sit in the passenger, and rock playstation 2
How da hell came in been tweekin out How you been
sneekin out, spent weekends out
She'll be tired of trainin dat month You probably be
fakin' like you came and you ain't even nut
Miss i'll pipe you til you get a pain in yo gut
The kid'll be responsible for changin yo struck
Wherever you hurt, i'ma rub it down I be ready
to smack it up, flip it in public now
I know how to get you hot, i know
how to hit yo spot If i take you home,
i know how to keep you stylin I know how
to keep you smilin if i take you home, let's go

I think it's just that ladies smiley I'm in love with my red 6
and got a crush on a navy caddy
I like'em deepcut, bust, with crazy fatties
They be wishin' i was just, they baby daddy
I'm the one that make it real easy
For you to just drop'em like he hot, like he lil' weezy
I ain't gon never make you feel sleezy
And i'ma put the roof up on the drop if it feel breezy
I love the way you smerk and giggle, jerk and wiggle
Throw yo legz up while i work the middle
Already told me how you strictly be witt'em
Now i'ma show you so much cash, that you'll quickly forget'em
I'm young, but know i'll have you in a bungalow
Fillin yo stomach wit cris, yo lungz with dro
I'll have you sprung fa sho It ain't gon be
no limit where yo tongue will go, ya heard me?

I like'em brown, yellow, peurto rican or asian
Who have the weekend occasion Sneak in the days inn
I'm never tweakin' off haze and frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that i stay in
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion
Now i just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, the first thing i peep a notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So you ain't gotta be perfect I'll buy you
whatever you want, but your heads gotta be worth it
Still what i mean is Your brains gotta
send chills through my penis 'til i feel like a genius
Look at it from a playa's position I got a
scholarship, i get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two three hours That's why i'm
the smartest young guy since doogie howser

Still what i mean is I really
just wanna get smart until i feel like a genius
And all that i ask is That you help
me get good grades, ma in all of my classes

These bitches they done got real bad Cause now i pull out
leavin'em lookin' like model for a got milk ad
I'm a teachers pet And even if you good at math
ma You'll have trouble countin' each baguette
All it takes would hood tutors and some good buddha
And promise to buy them some of them razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is Outta the blue
they stops biz They just start givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs Pocket full of
green, duke on it invented the light bulb
I might pass on a female and call up
a subsitute just for night Class in the c.l.
Ya man don't know why his chick knees be scarred
Can't tell him from givin' my dick c.p.r.
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squrtin
It's for certain You are the weakest link, goodbye

You know my girls in north and south caddy They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in texas, oral sexes
I head to cali, take more blows to the head than ali
And the philly momies suck the kid outta willie bonnie
And the way females so southern hospitality
in a.t.l. Don't even know them hoes
In south beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about vegas, the head is outrageous
The broads in seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in v.a.
Them hoes in detroit will suck the whole brevoort
My dick don't get to die down when i'm in chi-town
My bitches in b-more, blow til they knees sore
Good damn, there face i, ain't screwed out in st. lou
New york, it ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck it outta you like liposuction

Yo, if they want it, cowards get it They still
wonder how i did it Now y'all
wit it, these niggaz see how i spit it
Huh, these bitches see how i kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away Bitches be
yellin, "let me ride" like they snoop and dr. dre
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shit blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's william bonnie, stealin mamis
Dance closely, even know they feelin limeys
I ain't tryin to send police to ya rest I'm tryin to put this
piece to ya chest And you in piece wit the rest
You get released to the press - this how g's ride
From the north to the south to the east to the west

Yo ma, i got you stuck off the realness The name's fabolous
you heard i be In them trucks wit the wheels glissed
In v.i.p, with buckets of chilled cris'
'click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in
my truck That can make it feel like the block's movin
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin
Them boys in blue with the shields and the glocks movin
(you can't deny it) i'm the same ol' g
The gucci frames got the same gold g
Duke can you frame o-3, cause if you see me on ya
corner wit a 40 It ain't gonna be named olde e
I might be in chuck t's, or the chuckers
And if you duck cheese i'ma fuck her, duck these motherfucker
Ghetto fabolous, nigga i ride 'til i die
Hollerin 1-8-7 when i ride through the stuy

The kid pull the four out a little quicker You might end up
the reason, ya homies Will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap that's cool But the kid's
wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up
gettin told That ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, i'ma put this nine right
To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nothin but a g thang, i thought you knew
And i'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you'd do
Still don't know me, steell jump in the lex
The chain so icey, i got chill bumps on my neck
The narcs heard, how the krills pump in the jet
Still bumpin ya dex, still dumpin the tec, still

Yo, i ain't got no reason to trick or spend Mami
i'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickerin'
Playa like me? every season these chicks have been
Talkin' how i came through the p's in a sicker benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey i need freezers to sitck 'em in
I be's in the keys wit a click of friends
Trees and a liquor blend, i be too queezy and sick to grin
I dont care if a skeezer is thick or thin
It's gon' look like she havin' a seizure i stick it in
Skeos say "can i get the keys to ya six again?"
After i nut, that's when amnesia be kickin' in
Most broads i done met, ain't see a guy
Who spend a g on gucci t's, five for sweats
I'm what chicks strive to get, i stay in the p.j's
You thinkin greenwood i'm talkin' pivate jets

So the kid never stresses a female And if you ask where
i live they gon' give you Addresses to e-mail
All that cops can suggest is that he sell
How i'm gon' push it unless it's a v-12
From s's to c.l's, i request
is his detail In the head rests his t.v's dwell
They heard how many albums i presses for retail
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar
wit them crispy bills Gettin cris' re-fills
my wrist be chilled And my wardrobe look
like i got an ice berg history deal
Still dames have been givin me slow neck
And i don't even know what they real names have been
I feel ashamed to spend, 'cause when it comes to knockin'
'em down I'm right behind wilt chamberlin

Ma you musta had too many weed totes
'cause i ain't givin' you any c notes
I'm all about floatin' on them new skinny speed boats
Hundred and somthin wit two skinny deep throats
Winter hit, i'm in a new finny ski coats
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes
No more shoppin' sprees i'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins
I deal wit nothin but tens I be the
club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends
Chickens get keys, scuffin the benz
Cause they wanna lock me down like i'm puff in the pens
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link longview
i ain't tryin to put clinks on you
Hope trickin ain'n one of the things you think john do
Cause thats the way you end up wit a drink on you

If you wanna have smaller digits The kid was
never, a playa hata or baller bigot
Every week, pay em all a visit I bring
pamela lee to the p's so we all can dig it
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets
O.k, i'll rap a little faster
But do i really sound like i turned from a rapper to a pastor
I'm like you except i date supermodels
The cars that i drive, the state troopers follow
We get the same parties probably
My stones look like sunshine, yours partly cloudy
And i dont front for nothin'
I likes, i gets, i want for nothin'
I'm givin' ya straight answers And i'd rather be
dead than livin wit hate cancer

I just used to post on the corner, roast marijuana
I'd be on the coast of tijuana
Bitches who look, close to madonna,
In Dolce gabanna, toast by a nana
I 'posed to be wanna of those dudes ride
and test their roasters upon ya
Not to boast but i'm gonna keep toastin the armor
For niggaz who supposed to be drama
I mostly just wanna, get fed
garlic toast and lasagna Get head
while i'll roast in a sauna F-a-b-o
l-o-u-s, how can you hate that?
And i aint concerned wit the scandals
Cause its all bullshit my attorneys can handle
Ya insides be burnin like candles
Rippin down posters, turnin' the channels
You wanna end up on the urn on the mantle nigga, yea

I guess I'm the bad guy The fingers is pointing
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in
They be asking fellas why It's cause the streets is watching
With a envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin
I keep the home cell two way contact for Johnny Cochran
Be the same dudes, testing your patience In them hospitals
resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray ya Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments These playas been
playin' foul And I done learned my lesson with flagrants
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment
I'm what they been trying to do, not duke
I'm the kid, they been lying to you
You need people like me I'm so F-A
B-O, L-O, U-S Yeah, that's the bad guy

Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is yours
Quit they job and live off the child support
How could you stand there, smile in court I'ma just settle
and fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts
You better sign a pre-nup You catch me
instead of 'it wasn't me' I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'
I love the way your butt switches But none of these
slut bitches is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my inbox and my whole voice mail
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it Now every chick
want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters
Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real

What type of bad guy give fellas dap, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay on Riker's too long
Case dismissed, the DA even like the new song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool But don't change the subject fool
And start askin do I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me
be good guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me
I don't care what other haters do But if you think
I'm loved for saving you Say goodnight to the bad guy

Yo, fabolous strive for digits, even connive to get it
Niggas can't tell me nothin' dun, the 5 is kitted
For dead presidents any cat alive can get it
I walk around covered in ice like i survived a blizzard
Got enough chips to bribe you wit' it
Pay off security at clubs, get my guns and knives admitted
I'm the type that gets tried and aquitted
If my vibes ain't wit' it i pull the four-five and spit it
Then niggas run to the precinct and describe who did it
Come home and find the necks on their wives are slitted
I got niggas on my side comitted To leave you and
the driver splitted With your brain spilled inside your fitted
Fabolous, the only way to i.d. him is in a five bm
Puffin' sticky green 'till my eyes be slim
Operate with more chips than ibm
Fuck with me and make the news at five pm.

If ya'll see me gettin' locked it gotta be drugs
If ya'll see chrome on the truck it gotta be dubs
If i'm givin' somethin' to haters it gotta be slugs
If it's one thing it's gotta be it's gotta be thug
No info, i'm i'm leakin' it gotta be blood
If my earlobes are hangin', it gotta be studs
If the bitch on her knees, it gotta be love
If it's one thing it's gotta be, it's gotta be thug.

Niggas don't wanna play around, they see how calm i do things
Swarm in a blue range, armed with two flames
Flex play my joints, drop bombs like hussein
Catch a cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain
I got coke in every part of brooknam that you name
Niggas want it, when you wave firearms their views change
End up havin' to move they moms to ukraine
Get a.d.t. alarms and new names
Come in the club, under each arm is two dames
Buyin' bottles of dom with his loose change
Niggas hate me now 'cause i catch the eyes of dimes
Flooded the hood with tre's the size of dimes
Ride through the hood with chrome pokin' off the wheels
I'm in the game tryin' to get broken off with mils
Shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin' off the steel
Niggas love the band, but the bitches open off the grill.

I'm ready to address the haters and underestimaters
Hop in the truck, ride up on ya'll like escalators
Hit ya chest up, leave you hooked to respirators
Bed ridden talkin' to investigators
Now these ladies will do anything just to date us
'cause we skate around on ice like escapaders
Dressed in gators, in peace i'm restin' traitors
When police come for me, fly west to vegas
Ridin' or dyin', niggas know i'm ridin' with iron
Smoke compartment in the dash that i'm hidin' the pie in
My pockets is fat, ya'll accounts is on slim fast
I'm twenty, with twenty's on a m-class
Just gimme head it won't sweat your hairdo out
We ain't tryin' to hear you out we tryin' to air you out
Make ya'll rush to the stores and clear clue out
'bout to put cameras in the truck, take the rearviews out
